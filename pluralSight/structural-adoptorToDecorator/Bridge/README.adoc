# When to Use the Bridge Pattern

The Bridge design pattern is also known as handle/body. 
It is a structural design pattern, and it was created to decouple the 
abstraction form the implementation so that both can change independently. 
The Bridge design pattern uses encapsulation, composition, and inheritance
to make sure the different parts of our code can change independently. 
In this case, the objective is also that the client code will not be 
affected from any changes inside our code. Another reason that will require
us to use the Bridge pattern is when we have multiple inheritance 
hierarchies combined into a large number of classes. We duplicate all 
similar code, and we want to be able to easily combine different aspects 
inside our code into a new class without a huge overhead. Consider the 
following example. We have a Shape base class with a pure virtual method to 
draw that shape. Now let's imagine an application that has two different 
shapes, a circle and a rectangle. Since we need to draw, in order to draw 
our shapes on the screen we need to use a graphic library, let's say DirectX 
for the sake of this example. And so we inherit the Circle class with one 
that knows how to draw a circle using DirectX. And then when the requirement 
we were expecting arrives to add OpenGL support, for example, then we inherit
the Circle class again and this time implement the draw method using the new 
graphic library. Obviously, we need to do the same for the Rectangle class as 
well. We inherit it twice with two different implementations for the two 
graphic libraries so we will be able to draw rectangles using the client's 
graphic library of choice. But now we have a problem. With each new shape we 
add to our system, we need to create at least two inheriting classes in order 
to draw the shape using our supported environments. But there is even a bigger 
issue here. What would happen if I need to add support for a third graphic 
library, another way to draw shapes on the screen? Then I will need to create 
derived classes for every single shape in the system and implement the new logic, 
and that is a lot of effort which I prefer to avoid. As you can see in this 
example, a shape has two different aspects, the shape parameters such as radius 
or height or width, and what technology I use to draw the shape on the screen. 
Every time I encounter this kind of duplicate inheritance, two or more aspects 
for each class, I try to convert this structure to the Bridge pattern. In the 
Bridge pattern, we split the logic path of the Shape and the classes that inherit 
it, such as Circle and Rectangle, and use Composition instead of inheritance to 
create four different implementations. In this case, the Shape class has a member 
of a new type, DrawApi, which enables me to draw a shape using some form of vectors 
or points in a 2D space. Now, each shape can call that API regardless of the 
underlying technology, providing information on how to draw that specific shape. 
The DrawApi will then be implemented using the two graphic libraries we need to 
support, and if we need to add a third graphic library, all we need to do is 
implement the same generalâ€‘purpose functions that the shapes themselves will use.
