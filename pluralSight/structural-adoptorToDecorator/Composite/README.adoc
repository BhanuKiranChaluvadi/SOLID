# Client code

Clients code, or our main method

# Alternative before writing MovieInfo class

## Alternate 1
In client/main code , we can make a 
[source, c]
----
	std::list<MovieGroup *> groups_;
	groups_.push_back(&action_movies);
	unsigned total_watching_time = getTotalWatchingTime(groups_);
----
then we donÂ´t need to add two lines in the code But two functions of getTotalWatchingTime still exsists.
But in the future we need to find the size In future then we need to add two more functions.
with function logic.

## Alternate 2
We can combine both functions into one function and has MovieGroup as argument
[source, c]
----
	unsigned getTotalWatchingTime(const std::list<MovieData *> &movies)
    unsigned getTotalWatchingTime(const std::list<MovieGroup *> &groups)
----

## Alternate 3
We can also movie the function - getTotalWatchingTime to the MovieGroup class.
But that requires to handle both movies and the groups separately.

# Idea
What if i treat Movie/MovieData and MovieGroup similarly
